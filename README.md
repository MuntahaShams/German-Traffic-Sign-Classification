# German Traffic Sign Classification Using TensorFlow
**In this project, I used Python and TensorFlow to classify traffic signs.**

**Dataset used: [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
This dataset has more than 50,000 images of 43 classes.**

**I was able to reach a +99% validation accuracy, and a 97.6% testing accuracy.**

## Pipeline architecture:
- **Load The Data.**
- **Dataset Summary & Exploration**
